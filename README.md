## Intro

The stock dust shoe was breaking way too often so I decided to make my own. It would have to be in a fixed position so the spindle moving up and down wouldn't break the dust shoe. The design is inspired from [Alexandre Chappel](https://www.youtube.com/@achappel) and some of the parts are used from his design so I can't include them here but you can get them [here for 10$](https://www.alch.shop/shop/p/dust-shoe) or you could find alternatives online or design them yourselves (if you do, please consider sending it to me and I can include it here so more could use it). I used the ShopBot and the Ultimaker 3 Extended since it has 300mm height print volume. Since some 3D printed parts are bigger than most common 3D printers, they would need to be cut in parts.

## Building it

The first part would be the mounting mechanism and for that I reused 4 *(M6x1x14)* screws from the shopbot.
