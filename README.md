## Intro

The stock dust shoe was breaking way too often so I decided to make my own. It would have to be in a fixed position so the spindle moving up and down wouldn't break the dust shoe. The design is inspired from [Alexandre Chappel](https://www.youtube.com/@achappel) and some of the parts are used from his design so I can't include them here but you can get them [here for 10$](https://www.alch.shop/shop/p/dust-shoe) or you could find alternatives online or design them yourselves (if you do, please consider sending it to me and I can include it here so more could use it). I used the ShopBot and the Ultimaker 3 Extended since it has 300mm height print volume. Since some 3D printed parts are bigger than most common 3D printers, they would need to be cut in parts.

## Building it

### BOM

17  M4x0.5x22 Machine screws

17  M4x0.5 Nuts

4   M6x1x14 Machine screws

4   M6x1 Nuts

2   M8x1x24 Machine screws

2   M8x1x12 Pronged Tee Nut

10  T20x12 Wood Screws

7   T20x16 Wood Screws

4   T20x22 Wood Screws

8   

The first part would be the mounting mechanism that is 3D printed. It's 230mm in height so it's likely that it would need to be split in half to fit you printer which is fine. I reused M6x1x14 spare screws from the ShopBot to mount it. To fasten the wooden plate to the mount, there are M6x1 nuts that are inlayed in the mount and M6x1x20 bolts.
